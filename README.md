# Class-Summary- 
## Julio Ceniceros' experience learning the command line and GitHub
The **Command Line** is a very efficient and powerful tool.  
     *it* offers various functions:
* Access to all documents in the computer
* Is in an easy to understand text format
* Is a universal tool, to a certain extent

As mentioned by Perry:
>This is a computer language
>that requires practice and patience

Command line training has provided me the knowledge to navigate, access, and modify files and folders in my computer. This has been a completely new experience for me but I can already see the **major** benefits from using a command line efficienly. 

The **GitHub** training offeres a community environemtn for project development. 
 *GitHub* offers various functions: 
 * Creating new wikis
 * Contributing to current projects
 * Create online webpages
 
 GItHub is a combination of social media and professional project development.  The options of forking and branching offers the group members the chance to experiemnt and contribute with out any risks. GitHub is applicable in schools, corporations and governt labs and offeres various themes which can create very professional products.
